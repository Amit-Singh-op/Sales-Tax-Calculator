#Sales Tax Calculator
##Overview
The Sales Tax Calculator is a Java-based console application designed to calculate sales taxes and total price for a list of purchased items. The program follows these rules:

Basic sales tax of 10% is applied on all goods except books, food, and medical products.
An additional 5% import duty is applied to all imported goods.
Sales tax is rounded up to the nearest 0.05.
The application outputs a receipt that includes the item description, price (including tax), total sales tax, and the total cost of the items.
